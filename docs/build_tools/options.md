# Build tool options

mbed offers three build tools, as well as support for exporting to your offline tools.

## mbed Studio

The mbed Studio is based on the Cloud9 IDE and offers a rich development environment. For more information, see the [mbed Studio page](studio.md).

## mbed Online Compiler

The mbed Online Compiler is our in-house IDE, and should be familiar to anyone who's been working with mbed OS for a while. For more information, see the [Online Compiler page](online_comp.md).

## mbed CLI

the mbed command line tool (mbed CLI) was created specifically for mbed OS 5.0 and is an offline Python-based tool. For more information, see the [mbed CLI page](cli.md).

## Offline build tools

You can export your project from any of our tools to offline tools. For instructions, as well as tool-specific information, see [the Exporting to Offline Toolchains page](offline.md).
