# BLE tutorials

## Getting started

We have placed all of our BLE examples in a single GitHub repository, so although they are also available in the API pages, the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-example-ble) is the best place to see all of them.

## Going further

- The Mbed BLE [API reference](../apis/ble.html) offers the full details of the API.

- The Mbed BLE [online community](https://os.mbed.com/teams/Bluetooth-Low-Energy/community/) is also a great place to ask questions and share your knowledge.
