# Your first application

We have an example application called [Blinky](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-blinky-morpheus) that you can use to familiarize yourself with mbed OS and the build tools.

You can try any of these tools:

* [mbed Studio](#blinky-on-mbed-studio)
* [mbed IDE](#blinky-on-mbed-online-compiler)
* [mbed CLI](#blinky-on-mbed-cli)
* [Third party integration](#blinky-on-third-party-tools)
