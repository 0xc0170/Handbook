# Your first application

We have an example application called [Blinky](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-blinky-morpheus) that you can use to get to know mbed OS and the build tools.

You can try any of these tools:

* [mbed Studio](#blinky-on-mbed-studio)
* [mbed Online Compiler](#blinky-on-mbed-online-compiler)
* [mbed CLI](#blinky-on-mbed-cli)
* [Third party integration](#blinky-on-third-party-tools)

## What the tools do

All of the build tools perform the same process:

* Bring the mbed OS source code from GitHub, along with all dependencies.
* Allow you to set a build target, so that the compiled code matches your hardware and build toolchain.
* Compile your code with the mbed OS code so that you have a single file to flash to your board.
* 


## Before you begin

There are two things you need to use our sample application (and mbed OS in general):

1. A developer account on mbed.
2. An understanding of what we mean when we say "target".

## Blinky on mbed Studio

On top of your mbed developer account, working with mbed Studio requires a Cloud9 account. You can use an existing Cloud9 account or create a new one; either way, you'll have to follow the instructions on mbed Studio to link the Cloud9a and mbed developer accounts. 

mbed Studio does all the complicated work for you - it fetches Blinky along with the mbed OS code base it requires, and builds to whichever [target you]() need.
