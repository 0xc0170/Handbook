# Your first application

We have an example application called [Blinky](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-blinky-morpheus) that you can use to get to know mbed OS and the build tools.

You can try any of these tools:

* [mbed Studio](#blinky-on-mbed-studio)
* [mbed Online Compiler](#blinky-on-mbed-online-compiler)
* [mbed CLI](#blinky-on-mbed-cli)
* [Third party integration](#blinky-on-third-party-tools)

## Before you begin

There are two things you need to use our sample application (and mbed OS in general):

1. A developer account on mbed.
2. An understanding of what we mean when we say "target".

[TODO: Do I need any other account to work with C9?]

mbed Studio does all the complicated work for you - it fetches Blinky along with the mbed OS code base it requires, and builds to whichever [target you]() need.
