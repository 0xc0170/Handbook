## Blinky on mbed Studio

Working with mbed Studio requires a Cloud9 account on top of your mbed developer account. You can use an existing Cloud9 account or create a new one; either way, you'll have to follow the instructions on mbed Studio to link the Cloud9a and mbed developer accounts. 

mbed Studio does all the complicated work for you - it fetches Blinky along with the mbed OS code base it requires, and builds to whichever [target you]() need.
