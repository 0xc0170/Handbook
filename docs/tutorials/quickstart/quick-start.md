This quick start covers selecting your target in the Arm Online Compiler and creating your first application. It also teaches you how to flash your target and how to interact with your device. The guide leads to a broad range of examples, conceptual tutorials, end-to-end applications and other documentation, to empower you to develop on the Arm Mbed OS platform.

You can choose to develop **online** or **offline**:

- For online development, we provide the Arm Mbed Online Compiler. This is a great choice if you want to get started working with Mbed OS quickly.

- For offline development, we provide Arm Mbed CLI, our command-line tool. Mbed CLI is compatible with Windows, Linux and macOS. Mbed CLI provides more options, but requires slightly more setup.
