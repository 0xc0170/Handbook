=== Finding and using shared code ===

It's easier to find libraries and example programs, and easier to see what recent development has been done on them.
Getting updates of libraries you use is now more powerful - you can see exactly what changes have been made and you can easily switch between versions of libraries. Plus, the versions of any libraries your program uses are seamlessly tracked and updated in line with your program.

=== Improving code ===

If you spot a bug or an improvement in a library or program, you can always import it and make your changes. But now, it's a lot easier to contribute your fixes back to the original author. You would simply publish a fork of their library, and the author can pull your fixes directly into his compiler for review with a single click.

=== Sharing code ===

Publishing your code gets a lot more powerful - with full diffs, commit logs, branches and more. You still have the same auto-generated documentation, but you now also have a complete wiki with unlimited pages for each published program or library.

=== Working together on code ===

The single greatest area of improvement is in the area of more than one person working on a codebase. We now have three main ways to do this. You can manually pull changes from forks, accept pull requests from other users or to give permission for someone else to publish to your public repository.
