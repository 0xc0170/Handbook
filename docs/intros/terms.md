[TODO: This will need a massive edit, and additional info]

Suggested ideas:

API - Application programming interface

Arm Mbed CLI

Arm Mbed interface - The extra chip that sits on all Mbed Enabled development boards. It's what makes the target chip (for example, K64F) look like a USB drive. It usually runs a separate piece of software that generally doesn't change. That software is usually `DAPLink`, `CMSIS-DAP` or `STLink`.

Arm Mbed Online Compiler

Arm Mbed OS

Arm Mbed TLS

Arm Mbed uVisor

BLE - Bluetooth low energy.

Blinky

block device

board - An Mbed Enabled development board. You can see a complete list of these [here](https://developer.mbed.org/platforms/).

bootloader

build profile

build script

callback

CAN - Controller-area network.

CI - Continuous integration.

CLI - Command-line interface.

CMSIS-DAP - The precursor to DAPLink, this [project](https://github.com/mbedmicro/cmsis-dap) is deprecated due to known bugs. You should not use it in any new designs.

command-line

DAPLink - An Arm maintained [project](https://github.com/mbedmicro/DAPLink) that is under active development.

STLink - STMicro's [firmware](http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/development-tool-software/stsw-link007.html) that performs the same tasks as DAPLink but uses a different [driver](http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/development-tool-software/stsw-link009.html).

target - See `baord`.

terminal application

TLS - Transport layer security.
