## Mbed CLI

Arm Mbed CLI is the name of the Arm Mbed command-line tool, packaged as `mbed-cli`. Mbed CLI enables Git- and Mercurial-based version control, dependencies management, code publishing, support for remotely hosted repositories (GitHub, GitLab and mbed.org), use of the Arm Mbed OS build system, export functions and other operations.

This document covers the installation and usage of Mbed CLI. You can find our legacy CLI documentation [here](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-cli/blob/master/README.md).
