<h2 id="configuration-platform">Platform</h2>

The platform configurations allow for customization of platform level OS options. Such options include error handling properties and serial communication configuration settings for STDIO, which work out of platform as they affect system level printf calls, not Serial objects.

The following is the complete list of platform configuration parameters, as generated by `mbed compile --config -v`. Please see [the configuration system documentation](/docs/development/reference/configuration.html) for details on how you may use or override these settings.
