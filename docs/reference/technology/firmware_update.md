## Firmware update in Mbed OS

Mbed OS integrates the Pelion Device Management firmware update services, so if you have a Device Management account, you can send binaries to your remote device. The binary includes your full application and Mbed OS code, so you can update one or both of them.

Update support in Mbed OS relies on two modifications:

* Mbed OS now includes the bootloader that manages update verification and installation.
* Mbed CLI and the Mbed Online Compiler now support update actions, by wrapping around the Update Service and the Manifest Tool.<!--All of these will need links. Later.-->

<span class="tips">Since some embedded devices don't require remote update capabilities, Mbed OS does not include the Device Management Client by default. You will need to explicitly import the client to your application; this then includes the Update client, which manages firmware updates on the device.</span>

### Background: the Mbed OS bootloader

A bootloader is an intermediate stage during system startup responsible for selecting and forwarding control to the 'next stage' in the boot sequence based on validation. Optionally, a bootloader can also install an alternate version of the next stage upon request (firmware update, for example) or when detecting a persistent failure in the next stage.

Boot sequences usually have only three stages:

1. **Boot selector (or root bootloader)**: usually kept minimal to ensure dependable operation, and does not get updated (since there is no way to remotely recover from updating to a faulty boot selector).
1. **Bootloader**: a device can store multiple versions. The boot selector will attempt to hand control to the newest bootloader. If that bootloader is not stable or does not operate at all, the boot selector will hand control to an older version. This protects the device from being bricked by a faulty bootloader.
1. **Application**: follows the exact same logic as the bootloader.

### Bootloader requirements

To allow remote updates, Mbed OS now has a built-in bootloader that meets the following requirements:

* A minimal feature set, to increase the likelihood of correct operation.
* Each stage of the boot sequence (except the boot selector) uses a metadata header to expose data such as its version, size and hash. Each stage use's the *next* stage's header to verify that stage's integrity before forwarding control ("chaining"). Specifically, the firmware version metadata orders the firmware, so each boot stage can select the best among the next stage's available versions.

    An example of the header:<!--Is that the Mbed OS structure?-->

    ```
    typedef struct FirmwareHeader {
        uint32_t magic;                         /** Metadata-header specific magic code */
        uint32_t version;                       /** Revision number for this generic metadata header. */
        uint32_t checksum;                      /** A checksum of this header. This field should be considered to be zeroed out for
                                                 *  the sake of computing the checksum. */
        uint32_t totalSize;                     /** Total space (in bytes) occupied by the firmware BLOB, including headers and any padding. */
        uint64_t firmwareVersion;               /** Version number for the accompanying firmware. Larger numbers imply more preferred (recent)
                                                 *  versions. This defines the selection order when multiple versions are available. */
        uint8_t  firmwareSHA256[SIZEOF_SHA256]; /** A SHA-2 using a block-size of 256-bits of the firmware, including any firmware-padding. */
    } FirmwareHeader_t;
    ```
* A bootloader can change its behaviour based on where in the bootloader chain it is called. That means a bootloader can be reused in different ways in different systems, depending on its index position (where the boot selector is always 0, and each subsequent bootloader is an increasing index number). The bootloader therefore needs to receive its index as a dynamic parameter when receiving control from the previous stage, for example from a reserved space in SRAM. <!--But what mechanism does Mbed OS use?-->
* The boot sequence stages share their states with one another, using a dictionary of key-value pairs (the Update client also has access to this dictionary). The dictionary is checksummed to guard against integrity failures, and is platform-specific.

Because Mbed OS runs on M-class devices, there was an additional requirement: not to use virtual memory to manage different offset addresses. In Mbed OS, there, software always executes from the same offset; the bootloader copies the candidate image into the active image slot on startup. This makes the bootloader more complex, but it also allows for off-chip image storage, making larger images possible.

The bootloader is as generic as possible, and relies on a small subset of CMSIS (most importantly the storage driver). However, platform-specific implementation may rely on:

* Being able to drive a serial peripheral (such as a UART) for tracing, or an LED for fault detection.
* Fetching a "Reboot Reason" during system restart.
* A non-volatile memory to allow communication of commands and state between stages of the boot sequence.
* A jump mechanism to transfer control to the next stage. This includes an ability to:
    * Set the main stack pointer (MSP).
    * Update the vector table offset register (VTOR).
    * Set a program counter.
* Being able to reset the system upon failure.
* Watchdogs to trigger automatic reset upon faults.

<!--What sort of tracing does Mbed OS support?
"Optionally, each stage of the boot sequence could generate tracing output to record progress. Each trace message should mention the boot stage and system time (if available). Each boot stage should also emit trace messages revealing its build version at startup."
-->

#### Using the bootloader to manage updates

Mbed OS uses the bootloader and Update client to manage firmware updates. In short, the update client can point to the location of new firmware version for a stage of the bootloader. When the bootloader next runs, each stage will check for new version information for the subsequent stage; if it finds a version pointer "planted" by the Update client, it will hand control to the planted version.

The bootloader:

1. Takes over after reboot.
1. Checks the integrity of the active firmware by calculating the hash of the active image and comparing it to the one in the metadata header (the bootloader metadata header is explained below).
1. Looks for available firmware on the system. There may be more than one image, depending on image sizes.
1. Chooses the firmware with the latest timestamp.
1. Checks the integrity of the image in the storage area by checking its hash against its internal metadata header.
1. Copies the image in the storage area to the active application region if it is applicable.
1. Forwards control to the start of the active firmware, which contains the Update client (part of Device Management client). The Update client runs the Pelion Device Management update process:
    1. Receives a notification from one of its update sources.
    1. Downloads the new manifest and parses it to obtain the firmware URI.
    1. Fetches the firmware from one of its update sources. Either the manifest or a cost-ranking algorithm specifies the update source to use.
    1. Writes the firmware into the storage region on the SD card (or external SPI Flash), as a candidate firmware image.
    1. Reboots, handing control back to the bootloader.

####Â Using the bootloader to recover a device

In an upgradeable, multi-stage boot sequence, each boot component (`n`) can accept a new firmware for its "next-stage" (`n+1`), by incorporating the new firmware into its container for available next-stages. To ensure that a device can roll back from faulty updates, however, incorporating a new next-stage (stage `n+1`) firmware by the stage `n` bootloader has the following properties:

* Writing a new stage blob (`n+1`) is atomic. That is, a system failure during any part of the writing process should result in the partially installed next stage firmware appearing invalid.
* Incorporating a new stage blog in the container for available next-stages is also atomic. The container therefore remains coherent in the presence of system failures during the insertion.
* To enable rollback, the container keeps a certain maximum number of previously committed blobs (the maximum number is configured by the stage `n` bootloader).
* To enable rollback, the container can yield previously committed blobs of stage `n+1`.

Recovery depends on the boot sequence detecting and responding to failures. In Mbed OS, stage `n` of the boot sequence can determine whether stage `n+1` is operating correctly based on stage `n+1` confirming that it has launched and is stable. The stages use the shared dictionary to report their stages; stage `n` checks the state of stage `n+1` and determines whether to hand over control. If stage `n` sees that `n+1` meets its (implementation-specific<!--Does Mbed OS have a single implementation, or is it platform-specific?-->) definition of unstable, it will look for a different version of `n+1` to hand control to; this will be an earlier version, meaning stage `n` can force a downgrade of stage `n+1` to its last stable version.

The boot process ultimately relies upon well known images. Typically, the root bootloader doesn't change. There may also be default, well-known versions of intermediate bootloaders, and a default, stable version of the application. In the face of persistent system failures, all bootloaders will ultimately fall back upon default images to allow system recovery and usability.
