## Firmware update in Mbed OS

### Background

Mbed OS integrates the Pelion Device Management firmware update services, so if you have a Device Management account, you can send binaries to your remote device. The binary includes your full application and Mbed OS code, so you can update one or both of them.

### Architecture

### Bootloader

### Security

### Tool integration

Mbed CLI
<!--Don't need the manifest tool, don't need to access the portal if I'm only updating one device-->
<!--ship a bin file to a server, pull down a developer certificate (not update????) and call the manifest tool-->
