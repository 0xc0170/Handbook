Consistency is an important aspect of a codebase. To ensure consistency in Mbed OS code, we have created contributing guidelines. Any contribution to Mbed OS needs to meet the following criteria:

#### Design and coding style

Be consistent with your changes. We define software design principles and coding style in [this document](style.html).

#### Contributions guidance

The process how and how we review contributions is described in the [workflow](workflow.html) document.

#### Licenses

License should comply with allowed [licenses described](license.html). 

#### Access to the ARMmbed organisation

If you require direct access to the ARMmbed organisation for one of the following reasons:

* You need access to private repositories
* You need push access to a repository
* You are colloborating with Arm staff

then you can request to become an organisation member. Prior to this you must ensure your GitHub profile
meets the following requirements:

* All users must have 2 Factor Authentication enabled

* Arm staff must have their Name, Company (Arm), Location and Arm email address publicly visible

* All others should have their Name and Company visible. Location would be beneficial as it enables 
  us to know your region and thus interpret response times accordingly.
