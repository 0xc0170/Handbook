# Creating hardware and porting to mbed OS 5.0

If you're developing new hardware, or if you already have hardware but it's not supported on mbed OS, this section of the guide is for you. 

It introduces:

* [The *hardware development kit* (HDK)](mbed_HDK.md) that lets you design new embedded hardware. 
* [The mbed OS 5.0 porting process](porting_process.md) that can get your hardware working with mbed OS, so that application developers can use it in their products.
