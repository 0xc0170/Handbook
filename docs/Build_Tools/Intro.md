# mbed build tools

mbed supports four build tools: one command line tool and three IDEs. We introduce these tools through importing and building our sample program Blinky.

## Command line

* [mbed CLI](mbed_CLI/mbed_CLI.md)

## IDEs

* [mbed Classic](mbed_IDE/mbed_IDE.md)
* [Cloud9](C9/C9.md)
* [ARM Keil uVision](Keil/Keil.md)

## Third party integrations

If you want to work with other tools, please see our [Third Party Integrations](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/third-party-integrations/en/latest/) guide.
