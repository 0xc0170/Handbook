# Introduction to mbed OS 5.0

mbed OS lets you write applications that run on embedded devices. 

Your application code - written in C++ - uses the *application programing interfaces* (APIs) presented by mbed OS to receive information from the hardware and send instructions to it. This means you don't need to understand how the hardware works to be able to control it.

## Where to start

The easiest way to work with mbed OS is using one of our tools. We've set up an example that you can try with each tool.

Our online IDEs let you write and build applications for multiple devices. You can choose between our in-house [mbed IDE]() and [mbed Studio](), which is based on the Cloud9 IDE.

You can also use [mbed CLI](), our command line tool. This requires having a toolchain installed on your machine. 

## How to continue

When you've tried our example and picked your work environment, it's time to learn how mbed OS enables the features your application needs.

We've organized our APIs by feature, and have an introduction, a "hello world" sample and an API reference for each:

* [Hardware inputs and outputs]():
* [Digital interfaces and USB]():
* [Networking and communication]():
* [Device and networking security]():
* [Task management]():
* [Memory and file system]():
