# Introduction to mbed OS 5.0

mbed OS lets you write applications that run on embedded devices. 

Your application code - written in C++ - uses the *application programing interfaces* (APIs) presented by mbed OS to receive information from the hardware and send instructions to it. This means you don't need to understand how the hardware works to be able to control it.

## If you're a software engineer

Then most of this guide is for you. You'll want to avoid the Hardware Development Kit and porting guide sections. 

The guide covers:

* etc

#### Where to start

The easiest way to work with mbed OS is using one of our tools. We've set up an example that you can try with each tool.

Our online IDEs let you write and build applications for multiple devices. You can choose between our in-house [mbed Online Compiler]() and [mbed Studio](), which is based on the Cloud9 IDE.

You can also use [mbed CLI](), our command line tool. This requires having a toolchain installed on your machine. 

You might want to review our [glossary](getting_started/glossary.md).

#### How to continue

When you've tried our example and picked your work environment, it's time to learn how mbed OS and its tools enable the features your application needs:

* You can read [the general introduction to the APIs](APIs/intro.md), or jump straight into one of the APIs.

* Learn more about the [build tools mbed OS uses](build_tools/options.md).

* Try one of the [advanced tutorials](advanced/intro.md), which cover concepts like debugging and version control.

#### What we assume you know

We assume you're familiar with C++ and with using APIs.

We have a [glossary of mbed-related terms](getting_started/glossary.md) that you might want to review.

## If you're a hardware engineer

Then you probably want to see the Hardware Development Kit section, or the mbed OS porting guide (which also covers other components).
